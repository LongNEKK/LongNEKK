- Hi, I’m Jon
- I’m interested in math competitions.
- I’m currently learning object oriented programming. 
- I'm originally from Kahalu'u Hawaii.
- I'm a sophomore in Computer Engineering.
- I chose my major because I am interested in learning about computer hardware and I enjoy problem solving.
- A fun fact about me is I have a cat named Popoki.
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  I would like to get a better intuition for algorithm design as I feel that there is a certain threshold of problems for me where there is a big jump in difficulty, and I think a better sense of algorithmic thinking would be helpful to smooth the learning curve. 
- A book or movie I'd recommend is The Darkness That Comes Before.
